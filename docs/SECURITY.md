## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exposing users to potential risks.

### 2. Report the vulnerability

Please email security vulnerabilities to: **security@example.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What the vulnerability could allow an attacker to do
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Your contact information**: So we can reach you if we need more information

### 3. Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

### 4. Disclosure policy

- We will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been fixed
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update all dependencies to the latest versions
2. **Use strong passwords**: Follow the password requirements in the application
3. **Enable HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity
5. **Regular backups**: Maintain regular backups of your database and application data

### For Developers

1. **Code review**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer
2. **Security testing**: Run security tests before deploying changes
3. **Dependency scanning**: Use tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies
4. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
5. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Security Features

This application implements the following security features:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Password hashing using bcrypt with configurable rounds
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Role-based access control
- Session management with token revocation

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Password strength validation

### Security Headers
- Comprehensive security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- CORS configuration with allowed origins
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Database Security
- SSL-required connections to PostgreSQL
- Connection pooling with security parameters
- Audit logging for all database operations

### Monitoring & Logging
- Structured logging for security events
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Security event correlation

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Strong secret keys are used (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled and properly configured
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured appropriately
- [ ] CORS origins are restricted to known domains
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Logging is configured and monitored
- [ ] Regular security updates are scheduled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are in place

## Security Tools

We recommend using the following security tools:

### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **pip-audit**: Check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security issues

### Dynamic Analysis
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner
- **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner
- **Nmap**: Network security scanner

### Dependency Scanning
- **pip-audit**: Audit Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Snyk**: Continuous security monitoring
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Security Updates

We regularly update dependencies and security configurations. To stay informed:

1. **Subscribe to security advisories**: Follow our security mailing list
2. **Monitor dependencies**: Use tools like Dependabot or Snyk
3. **Regular updates**: Schedule regular security updates
4. **Security testing**: Run security tests regularly

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
